except for the functions about Markov, steady vector bla bla, we add new functions as listed below:
1. output dot file for NFA. The original code only provide the functions but not compile options, we fix it.
   the compile options is:
   --graph_nfa,-gnfa <dot_file>    export NFA in DOT format into specified file   --
   
2. warning!!! The pattern file should be not edited in Windows system, or you will be dead on running errors
